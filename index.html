                <p>I can't go fast enough <br>
                    To break free from the bond of your love <br>
                    And I ain't been strong enough <br>
                    To let go and let gone <br>
                    I can't see clear enough <br>
                    To look past the dust you left behind <br>
                    And I can't get high enough <br>
                    To forget why I cry (I cry, I cry) </p>

                <p>So I'll drive <br>
                    Ten thousand miles into the dead of night <br>
                    'Til I run out of love for you, baby <br>
                    'Til I've got no more love for you, baby <br>
                    Oh, I'll drive <br>
                    Ten thousand miles into the endless sky <br>
                    'Til I run out of love for you, baby <br>
                    'Til I've got no more love for you, baby </p>
                <p>I will drive all night, I will drive all night<br>
                    Leave it all behind, I will drive all night </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <p>I paint a silhouette (I paint a silhouette)<br>
                    In the shadow of every headlight <br>
                    I turn up my radio (I turn up my radio) <br>
                    But I can't turn off my mind <br>
                    Somehow you get to me (Somehow you get to me) <br>
                    It don't matter the distance I go <br>
                    Our love is dead to me (Dead to me) <br>
                    But I believe in ghosts</p>

                <p>So I'll drive <br>
                    Ten thousand miles into the dead of night <br>
                    'Til I run out of love for you, baby <br>
                    'Til I've got no more love for you, baby</p>

                <p>I will drive all night, I will drive all night <br>
                    Leave it all behind, I will drive all night <br>
                    I will drive all nigh, I will drive all night <br>
                    Leave it all behind, I will drive all night <br>
                    I will drive all night </p>
